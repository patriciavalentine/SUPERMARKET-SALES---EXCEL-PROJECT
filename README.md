# SUPERMARKET-SALES---EXCEL-PROJECT
This is an analysis and visualization of a supermarket sales data, to demonstrate my proficiency in data analytics, from data cleaning to advanced analysis and visualization, providing the actionable insights for decision-making.

#THE PROCESS:

1. Data Loading and Initial Preparation
I first loaded the dataset into Excel, to enable data access for subsequent analysis.
I then applied freeze panes to the top row to ensure that column headers remained visible during scrolling, enhancing data readability and navigation.

2. Data Cleaning and Formatting
I checked for spelling errors, to ensure data consistency and accuracy, particularly in the categorical data like the product line names, payment methods and city names.
I identified and removed any empty rows and extra spaces, ensuring clean and reliable data.
I checked for and addressed any missing values, which helped maintain data integrity.
I identified and removed duplicate values, ensuring each Invoice_ID record is unique.
I removed double spaces within text fields, which improved data uniformity.
I also formatted the date and currency, thus standardizing the appearance of the date data which enhanced the readability and prevented misinterpretation of the dates in the analysis stage.

3. Analysis
Calculating Key Metrics:
I calculated total cost of goods sold (COGS), sum of total revenue, and sum of gross income.
These provided a foundational understanding of the dataset's financial aspects, essential for subsequent analysis.

I then created pivot tables that enabled dynamic data summarization and multi-dimensional analysis, which I thought to be crucial for identifying key patterns and trends.
I created a pivot table to summarize total sales by branch.
- This identified revenue contributions of different branches, useful for performance comparison and resource allocation.
I also created a pivot table to analyze sales by city.
- This helped assess the geographic performance, which would aid in regional strategy development.
I created a pivot table to evaluate sales by payment method to determine the popularity and customer preference for different payment options.
- This would inform financial processing strategies.
I created a pivot table to assess performance across product lines.
- This identified high and low-performing product categories, which would possibly guide marketing decisions.
I created a pivot table to highlight top-selling products.
- This recognized key revenue drivers, which would help facilitate targeted promotions.
I created a pivot table to analyze sales trends over time.
- This identified temporal sales patterns, essential for forecasting and seasonal planning.
I created a pivot table for cost analysis by product line.
- This assessed profitability and cost efficiency across different product categories.
I created a pivot table to analyze the number of customers by type.
- This helped understand customer segmentation, aiding in personalized marketing strategies.

4. Visualizations & Dashboard Creation
Clustered Column Chart for Demographics
- This helped in displaying the distribution of different customer types, useful for demographic analysis.
Clustered Column Chart for Total Sales by Branch
- This enhanced visual representation of branch performance, making comparisons more intuitive.
Clustered Column-Line Chart for Top-Selling Product Lines and Ratings
- I created a combined chart to show top-selling product lines alongside their ratings; and this correlated sales performance with customer satisfaction, aiding in product quality assessment.
Pie Chart for Sales by Payment Method
- This provided a clear visual of payment preferences, informing financial operations.
Line Chart for Sales Trend Over Time
- Highlighted temporal sales patterns, supporting trend analysis and forecasting.
Clustered Column Chart for Product Line Cost Analysis
- Visualized cost distribution across product lines, aiding in cost management and optimization.

#Outcome:
This comprehensive analysis provided a clear understanding of sales performance across various dimensions, identified key revenue drivers, highlighted customer preferences, and supported data-driven decision-making processes.
This end-to-end process showcases my ability to handle real-world data analytics projects effectively.
